It's a simple tool to help you build your character. First select your base stats and then begin building from there.

This project uses simpleStorage: https://github.com/ZaDarkSide/simpleStorage, a form of local storage which will save the data to your browser locally. If you refresh your browser data you will need to start building you character again.
