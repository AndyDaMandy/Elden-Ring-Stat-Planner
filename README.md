# Elden-Ring-Stat-Planner

https://www.andresmaldonado.art/Elden-Ring-Stat-Planner/

It's a simple tool to help you build your character. First select your base stats and then begin building from there.

It currently works! Saving hasn't been set up yet, but you can currently build out 3 characters concurrently.

This project will use simpleStorage: https://github.com/ZaDarkSide/simpleStorage, a form of local storage which will save the data to your browser locally. If you refresh cookies, etc, it will need to restart.
